If the maximum number of players is reached, you may be unable to connect. If this happens, the game will not run. This is one of the main things this demo is designed to test.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this mode, you are able to shoot and kill both fellow players.

There are a plethora of bugs, and things we&apos;ve designed in on purpose for this test. If you brake to a stop, enemies will stay just out of range and will not fire on you. We would love feedback on positives and negatives you find, but please be mindful of the following known bug list:\r\n\r\n\n\r\na. Lasers fire straight. We&apos;ve toyed with options on making them fire with the direction you&apos;re looking, but we haven&apos;t quite worked out the mechanics yet.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nb.

Enemies sometimes float away above the vertical limit and get too far away to shoot. They don&apos;t respawn after that. Oops.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nd.

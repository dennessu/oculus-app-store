The Service and Oculus Websites and any Software are protected by the copyright laws of the United States, international copyright treaties and conventions, and other laws. All rights are reserved. The Service and Oculus Websites may contain certain licensed materials, and Oculus's licensors may protect their rights in the event of any violation of this Agreement.</p><p>6.2 Copyright Infringement. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the \"DMCA\") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted on the Oculus Websites infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Oculus Websites are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Oculus to locate the material on the Oculus Website(s); (iv) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (v) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by Oculus against you, the DMCA permits you to send Oculus a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Oculus Websites should be sent to Oculus's Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement as follows: <a href=\"mailto:copyright@oculusvr.com\">copyright@oculusvr.com</a>.</p><p>Oculus's Copyright Agent should be contacted only if you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring through use of the Oculus Webite(s). Please note that these notifications and counter-notifications are legal notices. Oculus may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute, or to third parties, at our discretion and as required by law. Please note that the information provided in these notices and counter-notices is not protected or kept confidential.</p><p>6.3 You may not use Oculus trademarks or trade dress in connection with any product or service that is not owned by Oculus, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers or subscribers, or in any manner that disparages Oculus or its licensors.

You grant Oculus all licenses, consents and clearances to enable Oculus to use such user-generated content for such purposes. You waive and agree not to assert any moral or similar rights you may have in such user-generated content.</p><p>If the Oculus Website to which you contribute user-generated content permits others to access and use that content as part of the Oculus Website Services, then you also grant all other users of the relevant Oculus Website the right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from and otherwise communicate and distribute your user-generated content on or through the Oculus Website(s) without further notice, attribution or compensation to you.</p><p>6.5 All comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas and other submissions disclosed or submitted to Oculus (<span class=\"highlight\">\"Feedback\"</span>) shall be the exclusive property of Oculus.

Equitable Remedies.</h3><p>The rights granted to you and obligations made hereunder to Oculus are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Oculus and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone. As a result, in the event that you breach this Agreement, you hereby agree that Oculus would be irreparably damaged if this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that Oculus shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as Oculus may otherwise have available to it under applicable laws. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages (if any).</p><h3>9.

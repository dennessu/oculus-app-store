This folder is the root of configuration data tree and accessed as a resource within a .jar file. 

We have two dimensions to organize config data. The first level is environment(e.g. onebox,int,lt,prod),
the second level is component(e.g. billing, identity). conf._default is the fallback search path for the first level.
